        <h2>San Juan College (Aug 2019 - Dec 2021)</h2>
        <p>In San Juan College this is where I first learned that coding is something I wanted to do.
         During the time I was there I learned Java, C++, IDE's, and got a certificate in CompTIA Network +.
        </p>

        <h2>TrueCoders (Current)</h2>
        <p>I am close to finishing this coding bootcamp and I have learned so much. During this course not only
            have I learned C# but I learned the core principals of OOP. I learned SQL and how to connect C# and SQL using
            Dapper. Now Im learning API's and web development.
